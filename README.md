These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Running Git at Kyoto University 

If using Git on a Kyoto University computer outside of the computer lab (Room North wing 21, Academic Center Bldg., Yoshida-South Campus), you need to use the version installed in your local user area (instructions for how to do this are given in Seminar 0: Introduction).

Each time you log in, to use Git you must tell the computer where to look for the Git program. 

Open a terminal (command line) by pressing "win key" + "R"

Then type 
```
cmd
```

and press enter

In the terminal type or copy and paste the following and press enter: 
```
PATH=M:¥Documents¥PortableGit¥bin;%PATH%
```

```
PATH=M:\Documents\PortableGit\bin;%PATH%
```

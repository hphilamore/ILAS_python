    "# Summary\n",
    " - Python (.py) files can be written, saved (and run) in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n",
    " - Python files can can run from the command line.\n",
    " - Storing functions and variables in seperate files and importing them for use can keep your program organised and tidy.\n",
    " - The python built-in `input` keyword can be used to generate user-input to the program while it is running.\n",
    " - Data from external files (e.g. .csv files) can be imported using the standard Pyhton library. \n",
    "     - A  file object has open(), read(), write(), and close() methods for working with  files, and features that describe the  file properties\n",
    "     - The open() method must specify a  file name string argument and a  file mode string argument, such as ’r’ to read the  file.\n",
    "     - Position in a  file, at which to read or write, can be specified with the seek() method and reported by the tell() method the Python with keyword groups  file operational statements within a block and automatically closes an open  file.\n",
    " - Pandas DataFrames can be used to store and manipulate data for anaysis.\n",
    " - The process of “pickling” objects stores a string representation of an object that can later be “unpickled” to its former state. \n",
    " - A pickle object’s dump() method requires arguments to specify an object for conversion and a  le name in which to store data. \n",
    " - Stored object data can be retrieved by specifying the  le name in which it is stored to the pickle object’s load() method. \n",
